**Hi, Halo, ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš”!** ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This blog is a personal hub where I share my thoughts, learning journeys, and research explorations in artificial intelligence, data science, and academic adventures. But letâ€™s be clearâ€”Iâ€™m not here to teach. Iâ€™m here to share, learn, and discuss with you. Together, we can grow and uncover new insights!

One thing Iâ€™ve noticed is the lack of advanced literature written natively in Indonesian on topics like artificial intelligence and data science. ðŸ¥² During my time studying and living in Korea, I was impressed by how many advanced materials were not just translated but originally written in Korean, offering learners more accurate and nuanced interpretations. ðŸ˜® This contrast highlighted the gap for Indonesian readers, as translations alone can sometimes misrepresent complex ideas. To help address this, many of my posts will provide native explanations in Indonesian, while some content will still be in English to reach a broader audience.

So, take as much knowledge as you can from here, share it with others, and letâ€™s develop and grow together. After all, learning is a journey that's most rewarding when shared with others. ðŸ˜Š And please, donâ€™t hesitate to correct me if Iâ€™m wrong during our discussions. Iâ€™m always open to feedback and new perspectives! ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜Š 

Enjoy exploring the blog, and feel free to join the conversation! Letâ€™s learn and discover together! ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
